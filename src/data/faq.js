    q: "Why my commits are not being shown?",
    a: `Note that commits are shown only after your Pull Request(PR) is merged. If your commits are not displayed, despite the PR being merged. The following can be reasons \n
                1. PR merged in the wrong Branch: While registering the project, the mentor is asked to select the branch, on which KWoC students will be working. If your PR is merged in a different branch, then your commits might have not been counted. Please ask your mentor to the branch from his/her KWoC dashboard.
                
                2. Wrong email configuration: If your email configuration is not set properly in Git and Github, Github doesn’t count it as a contribution from your account. Refer https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-graphs-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#:~:text=Your%20local%20Git%20commit%20email,appear%20on%20your%20contributions%20graph. To check whether Github has counted your contribution or not
                Visit the Project’s commits page on Github, the URL is in the format of “https:github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME/commits/BRANCH_NAME”
                In the list of commits, find your commit.
                Below the commit message, your github username and Github display picture(DP) are present. If instead of your DP, Github’s logo is present in grey color, it indicates that your email configuration is incorrect.
                To fix this issue, follow these docs - https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address. If you have followed the instructions in the doc correctly, your future commits will be counted by Github.

        If (1) and (2) do not help, please email admin@kossiitkgp.org with the following details- -Your github username, 
        - Github Repository link of the project you have contributed
        - Link(s) to the merged Pull Request
        `,
