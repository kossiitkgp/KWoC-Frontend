Dear Student!
Here are some updates and clarifications regarding participation :

    + There is absolutely no selection criteria for students. You are selected in the program as soon as you register. So you don't have to ask your mentors "How to get selected for your project?", but instead go ahead with "How can I contribute to your project?".
    + If can not find your college name on Kshitij Website, simply drop an email at admin@ktj.in and move ahead with the projects.
    + Students registration deadline is 7th December. Ask your friends to sign up soon.
    + Your mid-term evaluation is due by 15th December. You have to show some credible work by then to continue in the program.
    + Please be patient with your mentor. If you do not get a response on the communication channel, contact the mentor on their email id. If no response for 3 days, inform us.


Don't forget to write to us at contact@kossiitkgp.org for any query.

Happy coding !
